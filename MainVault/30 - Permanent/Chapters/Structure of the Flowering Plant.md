## The Plant Kingdom
- Flowering plants such as roses, sycamore trees and dandelions belong to the plant kingdom because they are complex multicellular organisms. They :
	- are **Autotrophic** i.e. they use photosynthesis 
	- contain a nucleus in their cells (*eukaryotic*)
	- have a **cellulose cell wall**
	- reproduce both **asexually** and **sexually**
## External Structure of a Typical Flowering Plant
A typical flowering plant made up of two parts: the root system below the ground and the shoot system above the ground

### The Root System
Some plants have a main tap root which may produce side (*lacteal*) roots e.g. in the dandelion and wallflower. Others have fibrous roots which grow from the base of the stem, e.g. in grass. These roots are very shallow
The tip of a root, i.e. the part pushing down into the ground, is protected by a root cap and further back is an area covered with fine hairs called **root hairs**. the root hairs are used by the plant to absorb water and minerals. The greater the number of root hairs, the larger the surface area available for absorption. 

The main functions of the root are:
- to anchor the plant in the ground
- to absorb water and minerals from the soil
- to store food ( in certain plants, e.g. carrot )

### The Shoot System
The shoot system consists of an upright stem bearing buds, leaves and flowers

The main functions of the stem are:
- to transport water and minerals from the roots to the leaves and flowers
- to transport food made in the leaves all around the plant
- to support the aerial parts of the plant, leaves, flowers, fruits
- to make food ( photosynthesis ) in the leaves
#### Buds
A bud is an undeveloped shoot. At the tip of the stems lies the **apical bud**, which is the place where upward growth takes place. Buds are also found on the side of the stem, usually in the **axil** of a leaf. Such side or **lateral buds** give rise to side shoots and branches. The axil of a leaf is the angle formed between the leaf and the stem. The place where leaves are attached to the stem is called a **node** and the space between nodes is an **internode**
### Leaves
Typically leaves are attached to the stem by a leaf stalk or **petiole**, but sometimes leaves are attached directly to the stem, in which case they are said to be **sessile**. The flattened leaf blade or **lamina** has many veins, which give the leaf support and allow transport of food, water and minerals. The veins may be arranged in a netted pattern as in the rose, wallflower and horse chestnut, or they may be parallel as in grasses, daffodils and spider plants

The main functions of the leaf are:
- to make food, in the process of photosynthesis
- to allow gaseous exchange, i.e. $CO_2$ in and surplus $O_2$ out - the gases pass in and out through tiny pores on the surface of the leaf called **stomata**
- to allow water to evaporate from the leaf in a process called **transpiration**, which helps draw water up the plant
- to store, in some plants, e.g. cabbage and lettuce
### Flowers
Flowers are formed from flower buds, which once the flower is formed do not grow any more. Flowers may occur singly, as in the tulip, or in groups known as an **inflorescence** as in bluebells, wallflowers and foxgloves .
The function of the flower is for **sexual reproduction**. A typical flower consists of groups of modified (altered) leaves arranged in rings or whorls. There are four main whorls, the sepals, the petals, the stamens and the carpels.

## Growth and Tissues in Plants
Growth in a flowering plant happens as a result of cells dividing, i.e. they
undergo **mitosis**. The region of active cell division in a
plant is known as a **meristem**. Apical meristems are found at the tip of the
shoot and the tip of the root, in buds and inside the vascular bundles of
some stems.
>[!NOTE]  **Meristem** is a region of active cell division (mitosis) in plants
