> **Characteristics of Kingdom Monera**
> 1. All single celled (unicellular) 2. All prokaryotic

##### Distribution
Ubiquitous - found everywhere - in air, soil, salt water, fresh water, on and in living body surfaces, on dead organic matter and in all extremes of hot and cold, pH etc. Wherever there is life, there is bacteria

##### Shape
Bacteria are classified into three groups on the basis of their shape
- Cocci (spherical)
- Rods or Bacilli (cylindrical)
- Spirals
##### Structure
Bacteria cells contain cytoplasm surrounded by a cell membrane. Outside of this is a strong cell wall, which protects the cell and prevents it from bursting when in a more dilute medium. Many bacteria that cause disease (pathogens) have an extra protective coat of mucilage outside the cell wall called a capsule. Bacteria are prokaryotic - they have no membrane-bound nucleus, with nuclear material being a single circular chromosome of DNA. Most bacteria also have one or more small DNA loops called plasmids. (In pathogenic bacteria, the genes for drug resistance are carried on plasmids. Bacteria can replicate plasmids and pass them from one bacterium to another, easily spreading antibiotic resistance among pathogens). The cytoplasm contains numerous storage granules storing food or waste products. Some bacteria are motile and move by means of one or more structures that are whip-like called flagella

###### Bacterial Cell vs Animal Cell

| Bacterial Cell               | Animal Cell                    |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| No membrane bound nucleus    | Membrane bound nucleus         |
| No membrane bound organelles | Many membrane bound organelles |
| May have capsule             | No capsule                     |
| May have flagella            | No flagella                    |
##### Reproduction
1. Bacteria reproduce asexually by a method called **binary fission**
2. When the cell reaches full size, the chromosome attaches to the cell membrane and re**plicates itself**
3. The **cell then elongates** to separate the two chromosomes
4. The two **chromosomes move to opposite sides of cell**
5. There is an ingrowth of the cell membrane and wall to split the cell in two

When conditions are suitable bacteria can divide every 20 minutes. This means that in theory each bacterial can give rise to approximately 4000 million, million, million cells in 24 hours. In nature, however, limited nutrients and a build up of toxic waste check bacterial growth. The rapid multiplication rate has important consequences: For example, any new variation produced by mutation like antibiotic resistance is spread very rapidly to a large number of bacteria. Wounds become heavily infected very quickly. When used in industry bacteria can give very efficient returns of product

##### Endospores
In unfavourable or harsh conditions, e.g. dehydration, excessive heat, adverse pH changes, bacteria can form an internal resting cell called an endospore. To form an endospore, the bacterium replicates its chromosome. One copy is surrounded by a tough cell wall to form the endospore. The original bacterial cell breaks down and the endospore is released. It remains dormant and when favourable conditions return, the endospore absorbs water and the endospore wall softens. The cell then reproduces by binary fission. Spore formation is not a method of reproduction - just a means of surviving adverse conditions. Some endospores can survive for centuries
##### Nutrition
Bacteria are either autotrophic or heterotrophic.

Autotrophs 
- Photosynthetic - make their food using energy from sun e.g. purple sulphur bacteria in hot springs
- Chemosynthetic - make their food using energy from chemical reactions e.g. nitrifying bacteria of nitrogen cycle

Heterotrophs
- Parasitic - live and feed on living host causing harm
- Saprophytic - live on dead and decaying organic matter

#### Factors that Influence Growth
The growth of bacteria is affected by a number of factors including **temperature, oxygen concentration, pH, external solute concentration and pressure**. Knowledge of these factors has helped has helped us develop different methods of food preservation.

###### 1.  **Temperature**
Each bacterium has its own optimum temperature at which it grows best but most bacteria thrive at temperatures between 20 - 40C. Some can tolerate much higher, low temperatures slow down the rate of the most bacterial growth. **Pasteurisation** uses *high temperatures to kill bacteria*, while refrigeration and freezing make use of the fact that most bacteria are killed or are inactivated by low temperatures

###### 2. Oxygen Concentration
Bacteria
- Aerobic - need oxygen for respiration. Most bacteria are aerobic
- Anaerobic - do not need oxygen for respiration
	- Obligate - Survive in absence of oxygen
	- Facultative - Can live or without oxygen

###### 3. pH
Each bacterium has its own optimum pH at which it grows best but most bacteria grow at or near neutral pH (i.e. 7 - 8).However, a few bacteria can survive very acidic or alkaline conditions. Pickled foods are stored in vinegar as the low pH kills bacteria.

###### 4. External Solute Concentration
The growth of bacteria is greatly affected by the external solute concentration, as bacteria gain or lose water by osmosis. If the external solution is more concentrated than the bacterial cytoplasm, water will move out of the bacterial cell. This dehydrates the bacteria live in an environment where the external solute concentration is lower than that of the bacterial cell. This causes water to enter the cells, but the cell wall prevents the bacterial cell from bursting.

###### 5. Pressure
The growth of most bacteria is inhibited by high pressure, as their walls are not strong enough to withstand the pressure. Some bacteria however can survive in conditions of high pressure, such as those at the bottom of the sea where pressure may be as high as thousand times greater than that at the surface

#### Economic Importance of Bacteria:
Although individually microscopic, the impact of bacteria is immense. A minority of bacteria are harmful - causing disease. However, the majority of bacteria are of great benefit to mankind in a variety of ways.
- Beneficial Bacteria:
	- Food production - **Lactobacillus** bacteria is involved in the production of yoghurt and cheese.
	- Decomposition of dead plants and animals recycling minerals
	- Genetically modified *E.coli* bacteria are used to produce a wide variety of products including human insulin, drugs, enzymes for washing powders and other valuable products.
- Harmful Bacteria:
	- Cause human diseases e.g. sore throats are caused by *Streptococcus*, Salmonella food poisoning is caused by *Salmonella bacteria*, TB or tuberculosis is caused by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*
		> > Disease causing bacteria are called pathogens, Other bacterial diseases include typhoid, tetanus, cholera, salmonella food poisoning, meningitis, leprosy, whooping cough, pneumonia, syphilis and gonorrhoea
		
	- Food spoilage - *Lactobacillus* bacteria cause milk to go sour
	- Cause animal disease e.g. brucellosis, mastitis
	- Cause plant disease reducing yield e.g. apple scab

#### Antibiotics
> [!note] An **antibiotic** is a chemical produced by micro-organisms which can kill other micro-organisms



**DEFN:** An antibiotic is a chemical produced by micro-organisms which can kill other micro-organisms.

Antibiotics are produced by both bacteria and fungi and kill bacteria and fungi but have no effect on viruses. Today most antibiotics are produced by genetically engineered bacteria. Alexander Fleming discovered the first antibiotic, penicillin in 1928 as a result of a chance accident in his laboratory. A bacterial plate was accidentally contaminated with *Penicillium* – a green mould fungus and all bacteria near the fungus died. When penicillin and other antibiotics were first isolated in the 1940’s they were hailed as miracle drugs, ‘magic bullets’ in the war against once-deadly bacterial infections such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and meningitis. However, since then misuse and overuse of antibiotics has led to a significant loss in their effectiveness. Within any species of living organisms, including bacteria in our bodies there is always some variation due to genetic mutations. Some mutations allow individual bacteria to withstand an antibiotic. Worse still, these bacteria are able to pass the genes for resistance from one species to another through plasmid transfer. Therefore, these antibiotic resistant bacteria have a competitive advantage over antibiotic sensitive bacteria. Therefore, they can grow very rapidly. Overuse of antibiotics (e.g. in medical prescriptions or animal feeds) has increased the rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria develop. These are not easily treated with existing antibiotics. New and stronger antibiotics have to be developed to keep up. In recent times bacterial strains have emerged that are resistant to almost all known antibiotics. These bacteria are said to be multi-resistant. One example of such a ‘superbug’ is a bacterium called MRSA. It is becoming widespread, especially in hospitals.
