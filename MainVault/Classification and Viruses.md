### Kingdoms
Living things can be classified into five kingdoms:
-  **Monera (Prokaryote) kingdom:**
	-  are single-celled organisms
	  - obtain food by a number of different methods (autotrophs and heterotrophs)
	  - have no cell nucleus
	  - have no membrane-bound organelles in their cells
	  - are prokaryotes.
  
- **Protist (Protoctista) kingdom:**
	-   are mainly single-celled organisms (and the algae)
	-  obtain their food by a number of different methods
	- have a nucleus in their cells.

- **Fungus kingdom:**
	  - are mainly multicellular (yeast are unicellular)
	  - are heterotrophs and obtain their food by absorption
	  - have a nucleus in their cells
	  - have cell walls made of chitin
	  - reproduce using spores.

- **Plant kingdom:**
	  - are complex multicellular organisms;
	  - photosynthesise;
	  - contain a nucleus in their cells;
	  - have a cellulose cell wall;
	  - reproduce both asexually and sexually.

- **Animal kingdom:**
	  - have a nucleus in their cells;
	  - are complex multicellular organisms;
	  - are heterotrophs and obtain their food by ingestion;
	  - have nervous and muscular systems (may not be present in simple animals);
	  - reproduce sexually mainly.

- **Viruses:**
	  - are non-living;
	  - are non-cellular and have no organelles;
	  - contain DNA (or RNA), and a protein coat (capsid);
	  - only replicate within another organism, i.e. they are obligate parasites;
	  - do not have independent metabolism;
	  - take over the host cell and make it produce more copies of the virus;
	  - may sometimes remain dormant in the host.
	 - Replication
		1. Attachment: The virus attaches itself to a specific receptor on the surface of the host cell.
		2. Entry: Once attached, the virus enters the host cell.
		3. Replication: Inside the host cell, the virus takes control of the cell's machinery and starts replicating its genetic material (either DNA or RNA).
		4. Assembly: Once the viral genetic material has been replicated, the virus begins assembling new virus particles. This involves packaging the viral genetic material into a protein coat called a capsid.
		5. Release: Finally, the newly assembled virus particles are released from the host cell.
		6. Infection: The released virus particles go on to infect other cells, repeating the cycle.



- **Harmful effects:**
	  - Viruses have a major effect on the medical and social life of a society by causing disease/death to humans or damaging food crops or animals, e.g. Ebola, Rubella, HIV, measles, tomato mosaic disease, AIDS orphans large numbers of children.
- **Beneficial effects:**
	  - They can be useful by killing disease-causing bacteria/fungi.
	  - They are used as vectors in genetic engineering.
