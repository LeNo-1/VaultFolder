# Hooke's Law
>[!NOTE] Hooke's law states that when certain elastic objects are stretched or compressed by displacement s the **restoring force is directly proportional to the displacement** 

$$F=-ks$$
- k is the elastic constant or the spring constant
## Simple Harmonic Motion
There is one position O where the upward force on the mass due to the spring is equal to its weight. If the mass is placed at O at rest it will remain there. O is called the *equilibrium position*.

A body moves with **Simple Harmonic Motion** if:
- Its *acceleration* is directly *proportional to its distance* from a fixed *point on its path*
- Its *acceleration* is always *directed towards that point*
$$a=-\omega^2 s$$
a-> acceleration $\omega$-> constant s->displacement

#### If a System always obeys Hook's Law:
$$F=-ks\rightarrow ma=-ks \rightarrow a=-\frac{k}{m}s$$
$$a=-\omega ^2s=-\frac{k}{m}s\rightarrow\omega^2=\frac{k}{m}$$
E.g Prong on tuning fork
### Terms Used to describe Simple Harmonic Motion
- a *cycle* or *oscillation* is the movement from A to Band back to A again
- The *period time* or the *period* T of a particle is the time for one complete oscillation
- the *frequency* f  is the number of cycles occurring per second. Measured in Hertz (Hz)
$$T=\frac{1}{f}\space \space and \space\space f=\frac{1}{T}$$
- The *amplitude* is the greatest displacement that the particle has from the equilibrium position.
$$T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}$$

### Simple Pendulum
**Apparatus:**
- Pendulum bob, split cork, string, timer, metre stick, retort stand

**Procedure**
1. Place the thread of the pendulum between two halves of a cork.
2. Set the length of the pendulum at one metre from the bottom of the cork to the centre of the bob.
3. Set the pendulum swinging through a small angle (<10°)
4. Measure the time $t$ for fifty complete oscillations
5. Divide this time $t$ by fifty to get the periodic time $T$. Calculate $T^{2}$ 
6. Repeat for different length of the pendulum e.g. 0.9m, 0.8m etc
7. Draw a graph of $T^2$ against length $l$ and use the slope to calculate a value for g

**Formula**
$T=2\pi \sqrt{\frac{L}{g}}$
$T^2=\frac{4\pi ^2L}{g}$
$g=\frac{4\pi ^2}{T^2}$
$\text{slope} = \frac{L}{T^2}$
$g=4\pi^2 \times \text{Slope}$

**Sources of Errors**
Angle greater than 10°
Not oscillating in one plane
Using lengths less than 0.3m and greater than 0.1m
**Precautions**
Use light thread and dense bob
Only oscillate in one plane
