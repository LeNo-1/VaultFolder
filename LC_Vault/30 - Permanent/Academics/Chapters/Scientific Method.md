1. Observation
2. Hypothesis 
3. Experiment 
4. Data
5. Conclusion
6. Replicate
7. Theory 

## - Planning and Designing
###### <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">A good experiment has:</mark>
- Carefully planned and designed
- Carried out safely
- Include a control 
- Be free from bias
##### Controlled experiments
- When carrying out an experiment, all conditions should be kept the same except the one being tested.
- The **independent variable** are the conditions kept constant.
- The **dependent variable** is the variable being measured.
##### Avoiding bias
- Large sample size
- Random selection
- Replicates
- Double-blind test *(placebo)*

 **Def. Hypothesis**
 ->A hypothesis is an educated guess based on ==observation==

 **Def. Experiment** 
 ->An Experiment is a ==series of steps== carried out to test the ==hypothesis==

 **Def. Data**  
 ->Data are the measurements, observations or ==information gathered== from an experiment

 **Def. Replicate** 
 ->A replicate is a ==repeat== of an experiment or procedure

 **Def. Theory**
 ->A theory is a ==hypothesis== that is ==supported by experimentation==
 *(A Principle is a proven theory)*

 **Def. Control**
 ->A control is a ==standard== against which the ==experiment is compared==
