### Order of Operations (PEMDAS)
1. Parentheses
2. Exponents
3. Multiplication and Division (left to right)
4. Addition and Subtraction (left to right)

## 2. Variables and Expressions

### Algebraic Expressions
- **Variable**: A letter representing an unknown number
- **Coefficient**: The numerical factor of a term
- **Constant**: A number without a variable
- **Term**: A single number, variable, or product of numbers and variables

### Evaluating Expressions
Substitute given values for variables and simplify using order of operations.

### Combining Like Terms
Terms with identical variable parts can be added or subtracted by combining their coefficients.
Example: 3x + 5x = 8x

### Simplifying Expressions
Use distributive property and combine like terms to write expressions in simplest form.

## 3. Solving Linear Equations

### One-Step Equations
- Addition/Subtraction: x + 5 = 12 → x = 7
- Multiplication/Division: 3x = 15 → x = 5

### Multi-Step Equations
1. Simplify both sides (distribute, combine like terms)
2. Move variable terms to one side
3. Move constant terms to the other side
4. Solve for the variable

### Equations with Variables on Both Sides
Move all variable terms to one side and all constants to the other side.

### Special Cases

## 4. Solving Linear Inequalities

### Inequality Symbols
- < (less than)
- ≤ (less than or equal to)
- > (greater than)
- ≥ (greater than or equal to)

### Solving Inequalities
Follow same steps as equations, but reverse the inequality symbol when multiplying or dividing by a negative number.

### Compound Inequalities

- **Or**: At least one condition must be true (union)

### Graphing Inequalities
- Use open circle for < or >
- Use closed circle for ≤ or ≥
- Shade the solution region

## 5. Absolute Value

### Definition

### Absolute Value Equations
|x| = a has solutions x = a and x = -a (when a ≥ 0)

### Absolute Value Inequalities
- |x| < a: -a < x < a
- |x| > a: x < -a or x > a

## 6. Linear Functions

### Given Two Points
1. Find slope: m = (y₂ - y₁)/(x₂ - x₁)
2. Use point-slope form with either point

### Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
- **Parallel lines**: Same slope

- **Perfect Square Trinomials**: 
  - a² + 2ab + b² = (a + b)²
  - a² - 2ab + b² = (a - b)²

### Solving by Factoring
1. Set polynomial equal to zero
2. Factor completely
3. Use Zero Product Property: if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0
4. Solve each factor set equal to zero

## 12. Quadratic Functions

### Standard Form

- **x-intercepts**: Points where graph crosses x-axis (roots/zeros)

### Vertex Form
f(x) = a(x - h)² + k where (h, k) is the vertex

### Finding Zeros/Roots

#### Factoring Method
Factor and use Zero Product Property.

#### Square Root Method
If ax² + c = 0, then x = ±√(-c/a)

#### Quadratic Formula
x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac))/(2a)

#### Discriminant

- Positive: Two real solutions
- Zero: One real solution
