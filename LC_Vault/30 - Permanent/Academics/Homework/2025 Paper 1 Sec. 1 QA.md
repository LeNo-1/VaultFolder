		I would agree to a significant extent with the writer's claim that humankind has a "fixation on status and prestige." While the article details our tendency to root for the underdog, it also presents a compelling counterpoint in its discussion of "social identity theory." The text states that we derive self-esteem from the success of our groups and that it would make "much more sense to align ourselves with the likely winners" so that we can "bask in their glory." This shows that our core inclination is to seek and attach ourselves to high-status individuals and teams, as their success directly boosts our own sense of worth. This tendency highlights that our preference for status and prestige is a fundamental part of our social nature, a psychological drive that the underdog effect must work to overcome.

		Furthermore, even the way we root for underdogs ultimately reinforces our fixation on status and prestige. Our support for the underdog, as the text reveals, is not unconditional. It is based on a "perception of injustice," and we are far less sympathetic if the underdog is "awash with cash." This suggests that we don't reject the idea of status itself, but rather we are invested in seeing it earned fairly. The underdog's appeal is that they are a worthy candidate for a rise in status, proving that "anything is possible with hard work and determination." In essence, our fascination with the underdog is a fascination with a different, and perhaps more just, path to the very same goal of achieving status and prestige.
