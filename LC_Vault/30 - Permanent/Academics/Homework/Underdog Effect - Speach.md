Lads, gather in. Today is the day we’ve been working towards for months, the day every training session, every sprint, every tackle, every sacrifice has been leading us to. We’re standing here not just as a team, but as brothers, sharing the same crest, ready to fight for each other and for our school. We may not be expected to win but that doesn’t mean we’re beaten before we even step on the pitch. If anything, it means we’ve got nothing to lose and everything to gain. That makes us dangerous, that makes us powerful.

Let’s go over the plan one last time. From the very first whistle, we need to set the tone. No slow start, no waiting around. We press onto them, we close down space quickly, and we don’t give them a second to settle. Their strength is in their passing – they like to keep possession, throw it around, and tire teams out. But we’ve studied them. We know that when they’re under real pressure, when they’re chased down, they make mistakes. Our job is to force those mistakes. Every one of you has a role: Backs, I need you on at their heels, stay on them, and communicate constantly; and forwards, be ruthless – every chance we get, we take. You all work for one another remember that. 

Now, let’s not fool ourselves. They’ve got pace, they’ve got skill, and they’ve been called favourites for a reason. But favourites often underestimate those who fight harder. What they don’t have is our heart, our hunger, or our refusal to back down. We’ve had to come through tougher battles than they can imagine. Remember the semi-final? Nobody thought we’d make it through, but we did. Remember the times we were behind and pulled it back? That wasn’t luck – that was grit. That was resilience. That was us refusing to accept defeat.

Their weakness is arrogance. They think this game is already won. Let’s use that. Let’s shock them from the start. Let’s show them that every tackle, every pass, every sprint we make is going to cost them. When they look across and see us giving everything, they’ll start to doubt themselves. That’s when we have control.

But most importantly, lads, today is about more than just a trophy. It’s about pride. It’s about wearing this jersey and knowing we’ve given absolutely everything for each other and for everyone who’s supported us along the way. Look around you – these are your teammates, your friends, your family for this game. Every single one of you has put in the work, and every single one of you deserves to be here.

So, when you step out there, play without fear. Play with courage, play like fire. Don’t hold anything back. At the end of this match, I don’t want us walking off that pitch with regrets. I want us walking off knowing we emptied the tank, knowing we fought to the last second.
