> [!Note] **Ecology** is the study of *the interaction between groups of organisms and their environment*
- An **ecosystem** consists of organisms and their interactions with the environment
- The **biosphere** is the parts of the earth and its atmosphere in which life can exist
## Environmental Factors
#### - Biotic Factors
<u>Biotic factors</u> are *living factors that are caused by the organisms present and how they affect other organisms*. They include competition, predation, disease, decomposition and effects of humans.
- Organisms can be divided into groups depending upon nutrition:
	- Producers which make their own food
	- Consumers which feed on the plants and animals
	- Decomposers such as bacteria and fungi which feed on dead and decaying plants and animals
- All animals depend either indirectly or directly on plants to supply food and oxygen
- Many plants depend on animals for pollination and for disposal of their seeds and fruits
- There is **competition** between plants for resources such as water, light and space
	-  Competition is the *struggle between organisms for resources that are in short supply*, such as food or light
- Animals compete for food, space and mates
- Animals and plants can carry diseases which affect other organisms
- Micro-organisms such as bacteria and fungi act as decomposers recycling nutrients in the ecosystem

#### - Abiotic Factors
<u>Abiotic factors</u> are the *non living factors that affect organisms*. These include things such as:
- Exposure, for example to wind or salt spray near the sea
- Altitude. The higher you are the lower the temperature
- Aspect (the direction the ecosystem faces): south-facing sites are warmer than north-facing ones
#### - Climatic Factors
Weather refers to conditions of the atmosphere over a short period of time e.g a day or a week. Climate refers to conditions of the atmosphere over a long periods of time, such as years or decades. 
Climatic factors that influence the life of an organism in an ecosystem include the rainfall, humidity, temperature, light intensity and day length.

#### - Aquatic Factors
In aquatic ecosystems like *ponds rivers and the sea*, factors such as how far light can penetrate into the water and the affects of the currents and waves and the salinity of sea water have an important role to play.

#### - Edaphic Factors
Edaphic factors are factors related to the *soil*. The type of soil it's pH and its ability to hold water and minerals will affect the different types of plants and animals that will live there. For example, very few animals live in a heavy clay soil as this type of soil has few air spaces. As a result, oxygen and water cannot pass through it easily.

## Energy Flow in the ecosystem
- **Producers** organisms that can make their own food e.g. grass
- **Carnivores** organisms that feed on animals only e.g. lady birds
- **Herbivores** organisms that feed on plant only e.g. greenfly
- **Omnivores** organisms that feed on both plants and animals e.g. humans 

### Food Chains and Food Webs
- A **food chain** is the feeding relationship between organisms in which energy is transferred
	- *grazing food chain* is a food chain in which the primary consumer feeds on a living plant
	- *detritus food chain* is a food chain in which the primary consumers feed on dead organisms
- A **food web** consists of two or more intersecting food chains
- A **trophic level** is a feeding level in a food chain
- A **pyramid of numbers** is used to show the numbers of individuals at each trophic level of a food chain
### Habitat and niche
- The habitat is the place where an organism lives
- The niche is the role of an organism in an ecosystem

## Recycling of nutrients 
### The carbon cycle
- Carbon is needed by organisms ro make many molecules such as glucose $C_{6}H_{12}O_{6}$, proteins and lipids
- The carbon cycle is the way in which carbon is taken and added to the environment by organisms
1. Green plants take in carbon in the form of carbon dioxide $CO_{2}$, from the air. They use this CO_2 to make food in the process of *photosynthesis*:
	carbon dioxide + water -> glucose + oxygen
	- plants also return $CO_2$ to the atmosphere during respiration:
			food + oxygen -> carbon dioxide +  water + energy
2. Animals eat plants as food. They release $CO_{2}$ during respiration when they break down their food to produce energy
3. The decomposers (fungi and bacteria) break down dead plants and animals, releasing $CO_{2}$, during respiration
### The Nitrogen Cycle
- Organisms need nitrogen to make proteins, DNA, RNA and ATP.
- The main source of nitrogen is $N_{2}$ gas in the atmosphere
- Nitrate is the form in which plants can absorb nitrogen
	- Some plants like peas beans and clover have tiny swellings called nodules on their roots. A group of bacteria known as nitrogen fixing bacteria live in these nodules and are able to convert free nitrogen from the soil air into nitrate ions, which are used by the plant to make protein
	- During the decomposition protein is converted into ammonia ($NH_{3}$). Ammonia is a nitrogen-containing compounds such as urine are also released by animals during excretion. Certain bacteria in the soil known as the *nitrifying bacteria* convert ammonia to nitrite ($NO_2$) and the nitrite to nitrate ($NO_{3}$) which is then absorbed into the plants.
		- There is also a group of bacteria that undo the good work of the nitrifying bacteria called *denitifying bacteria* ![[Nitrogen-cycle-nitrogen-fixation-nitrogen-assimilation-ammonification-nitrification-and-denitrification-918146238.png]]
