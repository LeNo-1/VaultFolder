### What is a Population?
A **population** is a group of individuals of the same species living in an ecosystem at a specific time. Examples include the diving beetles in a pond or the oak trees in a forest. Organisms live in populations for reasons such as having access to food and shelter, for safety, and for breeding. Biologists study populations to understand how their numbers change.

### Factors Controlling Population Size
The size of a population is influenced by several key factors:

* **Competition**: This occurs when two or more organisms compete for a resource that is in short supply.
    * **Contest competition** is a physical confrontation where only one organism wins the resource, such as red deer stags fighting for mates.
    * **Scramble competition** is a struggle where each organism gets some of the scarce resource, as seen with young birds in a nest competing for food.

* **Predation**: This involves one organism, the **predator**, hunting and killing another, the **prey**, for food. The populations of predators and their prey are linked in a delicate balance.
    * **Predator adaptations** include keen eyesight, sense of smell, and the ability to change their diet.
    * **Prey adaptations** include camouflage, warning coloration, and physical defenses like spines or thorns.

* **Symbiosis**: A relationship between two different species where at least one benefits.
    * **Mutualism**: A symbiotic relationship where both organisms benefit. An example is a lichen, which consists of an alga and a fungus that both provide for one another.
    * **Parasitism**: A relationship where one organism, the **parasite**, lives on or in a host, feeding on it and causing it harm. Parasites generally do not kill their host until their life cycle is complete.

### Population Dynamics
**Population dynamics** is the study of changes in a population and the factors that cause them. Population numbers change due to births, deaths, and migration (immigration and emigration).

A general population growth curve shows a slow initial growth (stage 1), followed by a rapid increase (stage 2), a slowing down of growth (stage 3), stabilization (stage 4), and eventually a decline (stage 5). Growth may slow down due to a lack of resources, overcrowding, disease, or increased predation.

### Changes in the Human Population
Unlike many other populations, the human population has continued to grow rapidly, especially since 1750. This growth is largely due to a decrease in death rates from improved sanitation, medicine, and disease eradication.

However, factors like **famine**, **disease**, and **wars** can cause human populations to decrease. Additionally, **contraception** has contributed to a decrease in the birth rate in many developed countries.
