dear diary,

i am in spain for the last month is amazing and it is so beautiful here, the people and the views. I went from coast to coast and i saw many cities but my favourite is girona. i like the old city and the food is delicious. Travelling solo is so great because i dont worry about anybody else and do what i want to do. The people are really nice to me here. I am going to go again. The problem i dont like is are the hostels because people stole many of my things, such as my shoes and a hat. I am tired of spain now and i wish to be home soon and meet my friends again on the first day of school. It has been a long time.
Anyways, i said enough.
