## Potential Difference
> **Potential Difference (V)** between two points is an electric field is the work done in bringing a charge of +1C from one point to the other.
> - Unit is the *joule per coulomb (J C^-1)* or also called the *Volt (V)*

$$W=QV\space or \space V=\frac{W}{Q}$$
> **Electric Current** is a flow of electric charge

## Capacitance
> The **Capacitance (C)** of a conductor is  the ratio of the charge on the conductor to its potential i.e. $$C=\frac{Q}{V}$$
> - Unit of capacitance is the *farad (F)*
 >- Basic function is to store charge for A.C.
 
$1\space microfarad = 1mF = 10^{-3}$
 $1\space microfarad=1\micro F=10^{-8}F$
 $1\space nanofarad=1nF=10^{-9}$ 
 $1\space picofarad=1pF=10^{-12}$
#### What is a parallel plate capacitor?
A **parallel plate capacitor** is two identical parallel conducting plates separated by an insulator ( Called a *dielectric*) 

#### Formula for capacitance of parallel plate capacitor
$$C=\frac{\epsilon A}{d}$$
- C - capacitance
- $\epsilon$ - the permittivity of the dielectric
- A - area of overlap of the plates
- d - distance between the plates

#### The energy stored in a charged capacitor
$$W=\frac{1}{2}CV^2$$
- W - the energy stored
- C - the capacitance
- V - the potential difference

## Experiment
### Using the electroscope to measure potential difference
![[electroscope-vector-illustration-labeled-electric-charge-measure-instrument-3270078816.webp]]
- The size of the divergence of the leaf is $\propto$ to the potential d conductor and the difference between the charged
- Work must be close to bring in positive charge from the ground up to the charged conductor
- This is because the positive charge is repelled by the positive charge on the conductor as it gets near it
- As charge is added to the conductor the potential difference between it and the ground increases. Thus its **Potential Increases**
### To show that a charged capacitor stores energy
Use the Equipment as shown
- Charge the capacitor by connecting the battery across it and close the switch
- Remove the battery and connect a bulb across the capacitor

- The bulb flashes as the capacitor discharges showing that it stores energy
