- 100 g granulated sugar
- 165 g brown sugar
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 115 g unsalted butter, melted

In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.

---
- 1 egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract

Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.

---
- 155 g all-purpose flour
- ½ teaspoon bicarb soda

Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (==Be careful not to overmix==, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).

---
- 110 g milk or semi-sweet chocolate chunks
- 110 g dark chocolate chunk
    - or your preference of chocolate

Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for *at least* 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.
