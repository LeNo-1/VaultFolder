>>> Roisin's Cookies

Scoop heaped teaspoons of @Nutella{15%tsp} onto a lined #tray, and freeze until solid. This usually takes 30 to ~{60%minutes} 

Once the Nutella has frozen, make the cookie dough

Preheat the #oven to 190C/170C Fan

Beat together the @unsalted butter{115%g} and @light brown sugar{175%g} until fluffy, and then add in the @vanilla{1%tsp} and @egg{1%medium} and beat again until smooth.

Whisk together the @all-purpose flour{275%g}, @salt{1/2%tsp}, @bicarbonate of soda{1/2%tsp} and @cornflour{1%tbsp}, and then add in to the other mix.

Add in the @finely chopped chocolate{200%g} and mix until combined.

Scoop the cookies with a 5cm cookie scoop to portion (or split into 15)

As you scoop each cookie, flatten the dough slightly into a disc shape, and add a frozen lump of Nutella to the middle and then wrap the cookie dough around the Nutella fully so its covered They will be balls of cookie in the end

Line 2-3 LARGE trays with parchment paper - and add 6 cookies to each tray. Each cookie might spread a bit whilst baking, so you want room for them to grow!

Bake in the oven for 11 to ~{13%minutes}, or until golden. The more you bake, the less gooey they will be!
