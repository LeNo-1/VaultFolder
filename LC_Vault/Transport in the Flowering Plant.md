Plants are **autotrophic** - They make their own food in photosynthesis
$$6CO_2+6H_2O\rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2$$
### Transport of Water
Water is very important in the plants. It functions include:
1. a medium for transport
2. a medium for cheminal reactions
3. a reactant in photosynthesis
4. maintains a turgid cell
-  Moves into the root hairs from the spoil by osmosis
	- Roots are well adapted to their rol
