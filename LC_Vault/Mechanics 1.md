## Experiments
Based on the sources, here is a short explanation of the key mandatory experiments in mechanics.

### **1. Measurement of Velocity and Acceleration**
This experiment uses a **ticker timer, ticker tape, a trolley, and a runway** to analyze motion [1-3]. The ticker timer marks dots on the tape at a constant rate, typically 50 dots per second, meaning the time interval between dots is 0.02 seconds [3, 4].

*   **To measure constant velocity**: The runway is adjusted so the trolley moves without accelerating, which is confirmed when the dots on the tape are equally spaced [4]. The velocity is calculated by measuring the distance for a set number of intervals and dividing by the total time (`v = s/t`) [4, 5].
*   **To measure acceleration**: The runway is tilted, causing the trolley to accelerate, which is shown by the increasing distance between the dots on the tape [3]. The initial velocity (*u*) is found from a section of tape at the beginning of the run, and the final velocity (*v*) is found from a section at the end [6]. By measuring the distance (*s*) between these two sections, the acceleration can be calculated using the formula **v² = u² + 2as** [6, 7].

### **2. Relationship between Acceleration and Force (Verifying a ∝ F)**
This experiment demonstrates that for a body of constant mass, its acceleration is directly proportional to the net force applied to it [8].

*   **Apparatus**: A common setup uses a **linear air-track, a vehicle, a pulley, and hanging weights** to provide the force [9]. Photogates connected to a timer are used to measure the vehicle's motion accurately [9].
*   **Procedure**: A force (F) is applied to the vehicle using the hanging weights, and its acceleration (a) is measured [9]. The experiment is repeated with different forces by transferring mass from the hanging weights to the vehicle itself. This changes the accelerating force while keeping the total mass of the system (vehicle + weights) constant [10].
*   **Result**: A **graph of acceleration versus force is plotted**, which should result in a straight line through the origin, confirming that **a ∝ F** [8, 10].

### **3. Verification of the Principle of Conservation of Momentum**
This experiment shows that the total momentum before a collision equals the total momentum after the collision, provided no external forces act on the system [1, 11].

*   **Apparatus**: A **linear air-track with two vehicles, photogates, and a timer** is often used to minimize friction [12].
*   **Procedure**: One vehicle (m₁) is given a push to collide with a second stationary vehicle (m₂) [13]. The velocity of the first vehicle before the collision (*u*) and the combined velocity of the two vehicles after they stick together (*v*) are measured using the photogates [13].
*   **Result**: The momentum before the collision (**p = m₁u**) is calculated and compared to the momentum after the collision (**p = (m₁ + m₂)v**) [13]. The results should show that the momentum before is equal to the momentum after, verifying the principle [13].

### **4. Measurement of Acceleration due to Gravity (g)**
There are two common experiments to measure *g*:

*   **Using a Freefall Apparatus**:
    *   **Apparatus**: This involves an **electromagnet to hold a metal ball, a trapdoor to detect when it lands, and a millisecond timer** [14].
    *   **Procedure**: The timer starts when the ball is released and stops when it hits the trapdoor [14]. The height of the fall (*h*) and the time taken (*t*) are measured [14].
    *   **Result**: The value of *g* is calculated using the equation of motion **h = ½gt²** [15]. Plotting a graph of *h* versus *t²* gives a straight line through the origin with a slope of g/2 [15].

*   **Using a Simple Pendulum**:
    *   **Apparatus**: A **pendulum bob, string, a split cork to hold the string, and a timer** [16].
    *   **Procedure**: The time for a number of oscillations (e.g., 30) is measured to find the period (*T*) for a pendulum of a specific length (*l*) [16, 17]. This is repeated for several different lengths [17].
    *   **Result**: A **graph of the period squared (T²) versus the length (l)** is plotted. This should yield a straight line through the origin, confirming that T² is proportional to l [17]. The value of *g* is then calculated from the slope of the graph, using the formula **T² = (4π²/g)l** [17].

### **5. Investigation of the Laws of Equilibrium**
This experiment verifies the two conditions necessary for an object to be in equilibrium when acted upon by co-planar forces [18].

*   **Apparatus**: A **metre stick, newton balances, and various weights** [18].
*   **Procedure**: The metre stick is suspended horizontally from two newton balances, and weights are hung from it at different points until it is balanced and stationary [18, 19].
*   **Result**: The two conditions for equilibrium are verified [20]:
    1.  The sum of the upward forces (readings on the balances) equals the sum of the downward forces (the hanging weights plus the weight of the metre stick itself) [21].
    2.  The sum of the clockwise moments about any point (fulcrum) equals the sum of the anticlockwise moments about the same point [21].

### **6. Finding the Resultant of Two Vectors**
This experiment is designed to find the sum, or resultant, of two forces [22-24].

*   **Apparatus**: **Three newton-balances and a piece of thread**, or a force table with pulleys and weights [24, 25].
*   **Procedure**: The three forces are applied to a central point (a knot in the thread) and are adjusted until the point is in equilibrium (not moving) [24, 25]. The magnitude and direction of each of the three forces are recorded [24, 25].
*   **Result**: Because the system is in equilibrium, the resultant of any two of the forces must be equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the third force.

Based on the sources, here is an explanation of the experiment to verify Boyle's Law.

Boyle's Law states that for a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature, the volume of the gas is inversely proportional to its pressure [1, 2]. The formula for this relationship is **PV = k**, where P is pressure, V is volume, and k is a constant [3].

### **7. Experiment to Verify Boyle's Law**

This is one of the key mandatory experiments in mechanics [4].

**Apparatus**:
The setup typically consists of a thick-walled glass tube, closed at one end, which contains a volume of air trapped by a column of oil [5]. A pressure gauge is attached to measure the pressure of the trapped air, and a pump (like a bicycle pump) is used to change the pressure [5].

**Procedure**:
1.  Increase the pressure on the air in the tube using the pump. After closing the valve, it is important to wait a short time (e.g., 20 seconds) to allow the temperature of the air to return to room temperature, as compressing it can cause it to heat up [5].
2.  Record the **pressure (P)** of the worktrapped air from the gauge and the corresponding **volume (V)** of the air from the scale on the tube [5, 6].
3.  Reduce the pressure by slightly opening the valve, which allows the volume of the trapped air to increase. Again, wait for the temperature to stabilize [6].
4.  Record the new pair of pressure and volume readings [6].
5.  Repeat this process to obtain at least six pairs of readings for pressure and volume [6].

**Analysis and Conclusion**:
To verify the law, you plot a graph of **pressure (P) versus the inverse of the volume (1/V)** [6]. If Boyle's Law is correct, this graph should be a **straight line that passes through the origin** [7]. This result confirms that pressure is inversely proportional to volume for a fixed mass of gas at a constant temperature [7].
