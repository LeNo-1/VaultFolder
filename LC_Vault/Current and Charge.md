#### What is Current Electricity
An **Electric Current** is a flow of electric charge
- The path around which an electric current flows is called a circuit
#### What are three Effects of an Electric Current
**Heating Effect**
Heat is produced at every point in the circuit, but mostly in the bulb

**Chemical Effect** 
A chemical effect occurs in the beaker as the current flows through it

**Magnetic Effect**
The current creates a magnetic field around the wire. This causes the magnetic compass needle to deflect from its normal North-South position

>[!Note] Electric Current in a Metal Conductor
An electric current in a metal is a flow of electrons

#### What is the Relationship between current and charge
> The **current** is the amount of *charge passing per second*
> $$Q=It\space or \space I=\frac{Q}{t}$$
> - Q - charge gone past
>- I - Current
>- t - Time
>- SI unit is the **ampere (A)**
